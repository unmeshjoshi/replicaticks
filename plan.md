# Deterministic Simulation Project - Development Plan

## Project Overview & Rationale 🎯

This project implements a **deterministic simulation** of a distributed key-value store with quorum-based consensus. The system simulates network failures, storage delays, and other real-world conditions in a completely deterministic and reproducible manner.

### **Core Design Principles**

The entire codebase is built on these fundamental principles that drive all architectural decisions:

* **Single-Threaded Event Loop:** The system is driven by a single master thread that calls `tick()` methods in a specific order. This eliminates the need for locks and prevents race conditions. All callbacks must be executed sequentially.

* **Determinism:** The goal is a deterministic simulation. This is achieved by single-threaded execution, simulated I/O, and the use of a seeded random number generator. Every run with the same seed produces identical behavior.

*On the Name tick
The name tick is intentionally chosen to evoke the image of a clock's second hand. Each call to tick() represents one discrete, indivisible moment in a "simulation clock."

*Two Roles of tick()
Service Layer (Network, Storage): The Event Loop Driver

The tick() method on these layers is reactive. It processes I/O operations that have just completed.

Application Layer (Replica, Client): The Proactive Logic Driver

The tick() method on these components is proactive. It is used for self-initiated actions like sending a periodic heartbeat or checking for timeouts.

*How This Ensures Determinism
Our design achieves determinism by systematically eliminating the primary sources of randomness found in typical distributed applications.

*Eliminates OS Thread Scheduling Non-determinism: Our design uses a single master thread. The main simulation loop becomes the only "scheduler," dictating the exact, repeatable order of all tick() calls and subsequent callbacks, eliminating race conditions.

*Eliminates Network & I/O Non-determinism: Our SimulatedNetwork and SimulatedStorage replace the unpredictable timing of real-world I/O. They use internal, deterministic queues based on a simulated clock, ensuring events always complete at the same tick and in the same order.

*Controls Randomness with a Seed: Some simulated faults, like packet loss or I/O errors, are probabilistic. To control this, we will use a pseudo-random number generator (e.g., Java's Random class) initialized with a specific seed at the start of each test run. By using the same seed, the generator produces the exact same sequence of "random" numbers, making probabilistic events completely repeatable.

* **Asynchronous, Non-Blocking I/O:** All I/O operations (network and storage) are asynchronous and must not block the event loop. We use a custom `ListenableFuture` for this, ensuring the simulation remains deterministic and efficient.  We can not use Java CompletableFuture because it provides a blocking get method and also has methods like supplyAsync which use a separate thread pool.

## Phase 11: NIONetwork Critical Client-Server Connection Fixes ⏳ **← NEXT**

### 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE: Broken Client-Server Request-Response Flow**
**Problem**: NIONetwork has fundamental architectural flaws in handling client-server communication patterns that cause data corruption and broken request-response flows.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- [ ] **🔥 DATA CORRUPTION**: Shared `readBuffer` across all channels causes data corruption and lost messages
- [ ] **🔥 CONNECTION DIRECTION CONFUSION**: `sendMessageDirectly()` has backwards logic for client requests vs server responses
- [ ] **🔥 MESSAGE CONTEXT LOSS**: No way to associate responses with the original request channel, breaking server responses
- [ ] **🔥 RESOURCE LEAKS**: Incomplete connection cleanup in error scenarios and connection close events
- [ ] **🔥 NO REQUEST-RESPONSE CORRELATION**: Missing correlation between inbound requests and outbound responses
- [ ] **🔥 BROKEN RESPONSE ROUTING**: Server responses create new outbound connections instead of using existing inbound channels

**Industry Comparison**:
- [ ] **Kafka Pattern**: Per-channel buffers, context-aware message routing, proper request-response correlation
- [ ] **Cassandra Pattern**: Channel state management, connection lifecycle tracking, response routing via original channel
- [ ] **TigerBeetle Pattern**: Minimal connection state, efficient buffer management, clear request/response semantics
- [ ] **YugabyteDB Pattern**: Connection pooling, proper cleanup, message correlation tracking

### 🔧 **Critical Fixes Required (Phase 1: Data Corruption Prevention)**
- [ ] **Fix 1: Per-Channel Buffer Management**:
  - [ ] Replace shared `readBuffer`/`writeBuffer` with per-channel buffers
  - [ ] `Map<SocketChannel, ChannelState>` with individual read/write buffers
  - [ ] Prevent data corruption from concurrent channel access
- [ ] **Fix 2: Message Context Preservation**:
  - [ ] Create `MessageContext` class to track source channel and message metadata
  - [ ] Modify `handleRead()` to preserve channel context with decoded messages
  - [ ] Enable proper response routing back to original channel

### 🔧 **Critical Fixes Required (Phase 2: Connection Flow Correction)**
- [ ] **Fix 3: Request-Response Correlation**:
  - [ ] Add correlation ID tracking between requests and responses

  - [ ] Fix `sendMessageDirectly()` to distinguish client requests vs server responses
  - [ ] Route responses via original inbound channel, not new outbound connections
  - [ ] Separate outbound (client→server) and response (server→client) flows

### 🔧 **Critical Fixes Required (Phase 3: Resource Management)**
- [ ] **Fix 5: Connection Cleanup**:
  - [ ] Comprehensive cleanup in `handleRead()` when connection closes
  - [ ] Remove channels from all tracking maps and clean up resources
  - [ ] Implement proper connection lifecycle management
- [ ] **Fix 6: Error Handling**:
  - [ ] Add proper error handling in all connection operations
  - [ ] Implement connection recovery and retry logic
  - [ ] Add connection health monitoring and timeout detection

### 🎯 **Implementation Strategy**
- [ ] **Phase 1: Critical Data Corruption Fixes** (Immediate - prevents data loss):
  - [ ] Create `ChannelState` class for per-channel buffer management
  - [ ] Replace shared buffers with per-channel buffers in `handleRead()/handleWrite()`
  - [ ] Create `MessageContext` class to preserve source channel information
  - [ ] Validate all tests still pass with structural changes

  - [ ] Connection lifecycle state management
  - [ ] Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] **Phase 4: Production Validation & Testing**:
