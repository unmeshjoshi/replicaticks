# Deterministic Simulation Project - Development Plan

## Project Overview & Rationale 🎯

This project implements a **deterministic simulation** of a distributed key-value store with quorum-based consensus. The system simulates network failures, storage delays, and other real-world conditions in a completely deterministic and reproducible manner.

### **Core Design Principles**

The entire codebase is built on these fundamental principles that drive all architectural decisions:

* **Single-Threaded Event Loop:** The system is driven by a single master thread that calls `tick()` methods in a specific order. This eliminates the need for locks and prevents race conditions. All callbacks must be executed sequentially.

* **Determinism:** The goal is a deterministic simulation. This is achieved by single-threaded execution, simulated I/O, and the use of a seeded random number generator. Every run with the same seed produces identical behavior.

*On the Name tick
The name tick is intentionally chosen to evoke the image of a clock's second hand. Each call to tick() represents one discrete, indivisible moment in a "simulation clock."

*Two Roles of tick()
Service Layer (Network, Storage): The Event Loop Driver

The tick() method on these layers is reactive. It processes I/O operations that have just completed.

Application Layer (Replica, Client): The Proactive Logic Driver

The tick() method on these components is proactive. It is used for self-initiated actions like sending a periodic heartbeat or checking for timeouts.

*How This Ensures Determinism
Our design achieves determinism by systematically eliminating the primary sources of randomness found in typical distributed applications.

*Eliminates OS Thread Scheduling Non-determinism: Our design uses a single master thread. The main simulation loop becomes the only "scheduler," dictating the exact, repeatable order of all tick() calls and subsequent callbacks, eliminating race conditions.

*Eliminates Network & I/O Non-determinism: Our SimulatedNetwork and SimulatedStorage replace the unpredictable timing of real-world I/O. They use internal, deterministic queues based on a simulated clock, ensuring events always complete at the same tick and in the same order.

*Controls Randomness with a Seed: Some simulated faults, like packet loss or I/O errors, are probabilistic. To control this, we will use a pseudo-random number generator (e.g., Java's Random class) initialized with a specific seed at the start of each test run. By using the same seed, the generator produces the exact same sequence of "random" numbers, making probabilistic events completely repeatable.

* **Asynchronous, Non-Blocking I/O:** All I/O operations (network and storage) are asynchronous and must not block the event loop. We use a custom `ListenableFuture` for this, ensuring the simulation remains deterministic and efficient.  We can not use Java CompletableFuture because it provides a blocking get method and also has methods like supplyAsync which use a separate thread pool.

## Development Methodology

Following **TDD cycle**: Red → Green → Refactor  
Following **Tidy First**: Structural changes separate from behavioral changes  
**Commit discipline**: Only when all tests pass, clear behavioral vs structural messages  
**Code quality**: Eliminate duplication, express intent clearly, simplest solution that works
